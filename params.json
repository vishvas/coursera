Regarding the BMI measure, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposes the following classification:\r\n\r\n    BMI <18.5 : Underweight\r\n    BMI [18.5-24.9] : Normal weight\r\n    BMI [25-29.9] : Overweight\r\n    BMI >=30 : Obesity\r\n\r\n## How is it calculated?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a formula for calculating the BMI measure. The formula is the following:\r\n\r\nBMI = weight(kg) / height(metres)2\r\n\r\nThus for the next example, the BMI will be:\r\n\r\nweight = 75\r\nheight = 1.8\r\nBMI <- weight/height^2\r\nBMI  23.15\r\n\r\n### Diagnostic\r\n\r\n\r\nThe function use for calculating the diagnostic is the following:\r\n\r\ndiagnostic_f <- function(weight, height) {\r\n    BMI_value <- weight/(height^2)\r\n    ifelse(BMI_value < 18.5, \"underweight\", ifelse(BMI_value < 25, \"normal weight\", \r\n        ifelse(BMI_value < 30, \"overweight\", \"obesity\")))\r\n}\r\n\r\nFor our example (weight=75 kg and height=1.80 m) the diagnostic would be:\r\n\r\ndiagnostic_f(75, 1.8) : \"normal weight\"\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BMI is a relatively easy, cheap and non-invasive method for establishing weight status, and for most people, it correlates reasonably well with their level of body fat.\r\n\r\nHowever, BMI is only a proxy for body fatness. other factors such as fitness, ethnic origin and puberty can alter the relation between BMI and body fatness and must be taken into consideration.\r\n \r\nfor more details: vishvaspatel34@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
